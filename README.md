# Deep-Iterative-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Face-Image-Super-Resolution
Face images are often used today for many purposes, including facial identification and recognition. Face identification is used in security to trace crimes. The face application performs poorly due to the camera's low quality and environmental degradation issues. 
In this thesis, we explore face image super-resolution, which raises lowresolution to high resolution images. We proposed a deep iterative convolutional neural network using attention mechanisms and spatial feature transformation for face super-resolution. The input lowresolution image is enlarged into a super-resolution face image. Then, the image has repeatedly estimated the alignment to enhance the superresolution image. The experiment was conducted on well-known facial
datasets. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are measured for objective performance evaluation. The
performance of the proposed method is compared with bicubic interpolation and other referenced methods. The results on the scale of 8 significantly increase by 0.32 dB in CelebA and 0.49 dB in Helen datasets. Additionally, the results on the scale of 16 meaningfully improve by 1.74 dB in the CelebA and 1.19 dB in the Helen datasets.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has the highest performance compared with other reference methods
